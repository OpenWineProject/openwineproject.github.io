# Open Wine Project

The Open Wine Project is currently a catchall for technology related topics that arise in [Open Wine Intiative]() forums' and SIG's. [The Open Wine Initiative]() is a consortium organized around the many facets of Wine.

The Open Wine Project aspires to define and advocate for sensible geophraphical and ontological standards that produce consistent interconnectivity and interactive artifacts.



Community participation is encouranged. Submit an [invitation request]() for access to the organizations tools (Slack, repositories, documentation, etc.) 


## Open Source
While the community, data and tools are all open, the effort is intended to make commercial use cases more efficient and consistent so various participants can plan better, plant better, grow better and taste better!

## Acknowledgments
Similar groups and initiatives exist however, many seem to lack community or activity or are otherwise abandonded and defunct. Many of the sources organized here were inspired by or barrowed from other communities and projects in order to bring organization, focus and a revitalized community. Every effort to cite these projects will be made however, source material will likely be unrecognizeable as it's modified to adhere to existing or proposed standards. 



<!-- This project began as an educational excercise so as to better understand global and regional vulticulture areas, optimal varietal growing climates and conditions and quickly grew to include interests in history, industry terminology and nomanclature as well as broader economical and commercial topics. -->
