# Open Wine Project

The Open Wine Project is a collection of data catalogs, ontologies, tools and more organized to support the [Open Wine Intiative](http://openwineinitiative.org).

While the community, data and tools are all open source, the effort is intended to make commercial use cases more efficient and consistent so various participants can plan better, plant better, grow better and taste better!

These are living documents and welcome community members to join to participate by emailing openwineproject@googlegroups.com.

## Why?

This project began as an educational excercise so as to better understand global and regional vulticulture areas, optimal varietal climates and conditions and quickly grew to include interests in history, industry terminology and nomanclature in addition to broader economical and commercial topics.

Similar groups and initiatives exist however, many seem to lack community or activity or are otherwise abandonded and defunct. Many of the sources organized here were inspired by or barrowed from other communities and projects in order to bring organization, focus and a revitalized community. Every effort to cite these projects will be made however, source material will likely be unrecognizeable as it's modified to adhere to existing or proposed standards.
