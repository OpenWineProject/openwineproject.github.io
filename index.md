# Open Wine Project

The Open Wine Project is currently a catchall for technology related topics that arise in Open Wine Intiative forums' and special interest groups (SIG's). The learn more about the Open Wine Initiative and the Open Wine Project visit the [about](/about) page. 

**Get involved!** Submit an [invitation request](mailto:openwineproject@googlegroups.com) for access to community tools.

## Getting Started

 - Source code: [Open Wine Project's are hosted on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/OpenWineProject). GitLab was chosen for the robust tooling and organizational flexibility provided out-of-the-box. Nested projects provide cleaner separation between interest groups like `ontology` and `cartography`. Both belong to the "Open Data Catalog" but exist in dedicated, nested repositories. Project websites are hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/OpenWineProject/openwineproject.github.io)â€”it's just easier.
