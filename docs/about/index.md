# Open Wine Project

The Open Wine Project is an open source, community-driven study guide for oenolophiles and an evolving catalog of wine geography, ontology and history.

## Projects

The Open Wine Project aspires to define and advocate for sensible geophraphical and ontological standards that produce consistent interconnectivity and interactive artifacts for the continued examination of the world of wine.
