# Wine Cartography

Objective: Map the wine world.

The aspirations for this project are as board as the topic itself is defined:

> **cartography** /kär-tŏg′rə-fē/ noun
> 1. The art or technique of making maps or charts.
> 2. The art or business of forming charts or maps.
> 3. The making of maps and charts.
> 
> — _The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, 5th Edition_

Two very smart examples provided by the UC Davis Library GitHub and, as best as I can tell, [Ronan Guilloux](https://github.com/ronanguilloux) of OpenWines in France, [cite source] and [cite source], are providing some base assumptions and guiding principles.
